Nothing exciting. Mostly compiled.

_Okay, a bit exciting._ ⚡️

Here I try to credit the sources / inspiration since I haven't forked this properly:

* [George Crawford](https://github.com/georgecrawford/dotfiles) thanks for much of the files. Too cool.
* [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) thanks for `bootstrap.sh`.

Enjoy!
